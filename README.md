# UserCRUD
CRUD operations on user

Hi there,

In this demo CRUD application i have created 5 main functionalities which are documented with the help of Swagger UI which can be accessed after downloading the Spring Boot 
application. Once the application is booted you can access the Swagger UI via http://localhost:8201/swagger-ui.html URL. Swagger UI will inturn guide you through complete 
application.

In this project I have used Java version 1.8. 

I have used following dependencies:-
1. spring-boot-starter-web - To create a web application
2. jackson-databind - To bind incoming Json to Pojo.
3. springfox-swagger2 - To have Swagger. 
4. springfox-swagger-ui - To have Swagger UI.
